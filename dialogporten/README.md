## Getting started with local development

### Mac 

#### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0) (see [global.json](global.json) for the currently required version)
  - Remember to install and trust the dotnet dev certificates: `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`

#### Installing Podman (Mac)

1. Install [Podman](https://podman.io/)

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
brew tap cfergeau/crc
# https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/21064
brew install vfkit
brew install docker-compose
```

3. Restart your Mac

4. Finish setup in Podman Desktop

5. Check that `Docker Compatibility mode` is enabled, see the bottom left corner

6. If you have an M4 processor, check that the Podman Machine uses `LibKRun` not `Apple Hypervisor`. 
   Otherwise, recreate the Podman Machine and change the setting.
   Note: This is a workaround for `dotnet build` crashing inside containers on M4.

7. Enable privileged [testcontainers-dotnet](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-dotnet/issues/876#issuecomment-1930397928)  
`echo "ryuk.container.privileged = true" >> $HOME/.testcontainers.properties`

### Windows 

#### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0) (see [global.json](global.json) for the currently required version)
- [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (To install, open a PowerShell admin window and run `wsl --install`)
- [Virtual Machine Platform](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-11-pcs-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1) (Installs with WSL2, see the link above)

#### Installing Podman (Windows)

1. Install [Podman Desktop](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).
 
2. Start Podman Desktop and follow instructions to install Podman.

3. Follow instructions in Podman Desktop to create and start a Podman machine.

4. In Podman Desktop, go to Settings → Resources and run setup for the Compose Extension. This will install docker-compose.

### Running the project

You can run the entire project locally using `podman compose`. (This uses docker-compose behind the scenes.)
```powershell
podman compose up
```

For local dev, the WebAPI and GraphQl containers read dotnet user secrets from `/home/app/.microsoft/usersecrets` in the container.
We mount your host secrets folder into that location via `USER_SECRETS_DIR`.
If you are on Windows, set `USER_SECRETS_DIR` to `%APPDATA%/Microsoft/UserSecrets` before running `podman compose`.

The following GUI services should now be available:
* WebAPI/SwaggerUI: [localhost:7214/swagger](https://localhost:7214/swagger/index.html)
* WebAPI/Scalar: [localhost:7214/scalar](https://localhost:7214/scalar)
* GraphQl/Nitro: [localhost:7215/graphql](https://localhost:7215/graphql)
* Redis/Insight: [localhost:7216](https://localhost:7216)

The WebAPI and GraphQl services are behind a nginx proxy, and you can change the number of replicas by setting the `scale` property in the `docker-compose.yml` file.


### Running the WebApi/GraphQl in an IDE
If you need do debug the WebApi/GraphQl projects in an IDE, you can alternatively run `podman compose` without the WebAPI/GraphQl.  
First, create a dotnet user secret for the DB connection string.

```powershell
dotnet user-secrets set -p "./src/Digdir.Domain.Dialogporten.WebApi" "Infrastructure:DialogDbConnectionString" "Server=localhost;Port=15432;Database=dialogporten;User ID=postgres;Password=supersecret;Include Error Detail=True;"
```

Then run `podman compose` without the WebAPI/GraphQl projects.
```powershell
podman compose -f docker-compose-db-redis.yml up 
```

### NuGet lock files
NuGet restore writes `packages.lock.json` for each project, and CI/Docker restores use `--locked-mode` so dependency graph changes must be committed. After changing package references locally, run `dotnet restore` and include the updated lock files in the PR; Renovate updates them in dependency PRs.

## DB development
This project uses Entity Framework Core to manage DB migrations. DB development can either be done through Visual Studio's Package Manager Console (PMC) or through the CLI. 

### DB development through PMC
Set Digdir.Domain.Dialogporten.Infrastructure as the startup project in Visual Studio's solution explorer, and as the default project in PMC. You are now ready to use [EF core tools through PMC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/powershell). 
Run the following command for more information:
```powershell
Get-Help about_EntityFrameworkCore
```

### DB development through CLI
Install the CLI tool with the following command:
```powershell
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

You are now ready to use [EF core tools through CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet). Run the following command for more information:
```powershell
dotnet ef --help
```

Remember to target `Digdir.Domain.Dialogporten.Infrastructure` project when running the CLI commands. Either target it through the command using the `-p` option, i.e.
```powershell
dotnet ef migrations add -p .\src\Digdir.Domain.Dialogporten.Infrastructure\ TestMigration
```

Or change your directory to the infrastructure project and then run the command.
```powershell
cd .\src\Digdir.Domain.Dialogporten.Infrastructure\
dotnet ef migrations add TestMigration
```

### Restoring a database from an Azure backup
See [docs/RestoreDatabase.md](docs/RestoreDatabase.md)

## Health Checks

The project includes integrated health checks that are exposed through standard endpoints:
- `/health/startup` - Dependency checks
- `/health/liveness` - Self checks
- `/health/readiness` - Critical service checks
- `/health` - General health status
- `/health/deep` - Comprehensive health check including external services

These health checks are integrated with Azure Container Apps' health probe system and are used to monitor the application's health status.

## Observability with OpenTelemetry

This project uses OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, metrics collection, and logging. The setup includes:

### Core Features
- Distributed tracing across services
- Runtime and application metrics
- Log aggregation and correlation
- Integration with Azure Monitor/Application Insights
- Support for both OTLP and Azure Monitor exporters
- Automatic instrumentation for:
  - ASP.NET Core
  - HTTP clients
  - Entity Framework Core
  - PostgreSQL
  - FusionCache

### Configuration

OpenTelemetry is configured through environment variables that are automatically provided by Azure Container Apps in production environments:

```json
{
    "OTEL_SERVICE_NAME": "your-service-name",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT": "http://your-collector:4317",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL": "grpc",
    "OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES": "key1=value1,key2=value2",
    "APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING": "your-connection-string"
}
```

### Local Development

For local development, the project includes a docker-compose setup with:
- OpenTelemetry Collector (ports 4317/4318 for OTLP receivers)
- Grafana (port 3000)
- Jaeger (port 16686)
- Loki (port 3100)
- Prometheus (port 9090)

To run the local observability stack:
```bash
podman compose -f docker-compose-otel.yml up
```

### Accessing Observability Tools

Once the local stack is running, you can access the following tools:

#### Distributed Tracing with Jaeger
- URL: http://localhost:16686
- Features:
  - View distributed traces across services
  - Search by service, operation, or trace ID
  - Analyze timing and dependencies
  - Debug request flows and errors

#### Metrics with Prometheus
- URL: http://localhost:9090
- Features:
  - Query raw metrics data
  - View metric targets and service discovery
  - Debug metric collection

#### Log Aggregation with Loki
- Direct URL: http://localhost:3100
- Grafana Integration: http://localhost:3000 (preferred interface)
- Features:
  - Search and filter logs across all services
  - Correlate logs with traces using trace IDs
  - Create log-based alerts and dashboards
  - Use LogQL to query logs:
    ```logql
    # Example: Find all error logs
    {container="web-api"} |= "error"
    
    # Example: Find logs with specific trace ID
    {container=~"web-api|graphql"} |~ "trace_id=([a-f0-9]{32})"
    ```

#### Metrics and Dashboards in Grafana
- URL: http://localhost:3000
- Features:
  - Pre-configured dashboards for:
    - Application metrics
    - Runtime metrics
    - HTTP request metrics
  - Data sources:
    - Prometheus (metrics)
    - Loki (logs)
    - Jaeger (traces)
  - Create custom dashboards
  - Set up alerts

#### OpenTelemetry Collector Endpoints
- OTLP gRPC receiver: localhost:4317
- OTLP HTTP receiver: localhost:4318
- Prometheus metrics: localhost:8888
- Prometheus exporter metrics: localhost:8889

### Request Filtering

The telemetry setup includes smart filtering to:
- Exclude health check endpoints from tracing
- Filter out duplicate traces from Azure SDK clients
- Only record relevant HTTP client calls

For more details about the OpenTelemetry setup, see the `ConfigureTelemetry` method in `AspNetUtilitiesExtensions.cs`.

## Updating the SDK in global.json
When RenovateBot updates `global.json` or base image versions in Dockerfiles, make sure they match. 
The `global.json` file should always have the same SDK version as the base image in the Dockerfiles. 
This is to ensure that the SDK version used in the local development environment matches the SDK version used in the CI/CD pipeline. 
`global.json` is used when building the solution in CI/CD.

## Development in local and test environments
To generate test tokens, see https://github.com/Altinn/AltinnTestTools. There is a request in the [Bruno collection](https://github.com/Altinn/dialogporten-bruno) for this.  

### Local development settings
We are able to toggle some external resources in local development. This is done through the `appsettings.Development.json` file. The following settings are available:
```json
"LocalDevelopment": {
    "UseLocalDevelopmentUser": true,
    "UseLocalDevelopmentResourceRegister": true,
    "UseLocalDevelopmentOrganizationRegister": true,
    "UseLocalDevelopmentNameRegister": true,
    "UseLocalDevelopmentPartyNameRegistry": true,
    "UseLocalDevelopmentAltinnAuthorization": true,
    "UseLocalDevelopmentCloudEventBus": true,
    "UseLocalDevelopmentCompactJwsGenerator": true,
    "DisableCache": true,
    "DisableAuth": true,
    "UseInMemoryServiceBusTransport": true,
    "DisableSubjectResourceSyncOnStartup": false,
    "DisablePolicyInformationSyncOnStartup": true,
    "UseLocalMetricsAggregationStorage": true
}
```
Toggling these flags will enable/disable the external resources. The `DisableAuth` flag, for example, will disable authentication in the WebAPI project. This is useful when debugging the WebAPI project in an IDE. These settings will only be respected in the `Development` environment.

### Using `appsettings.local.json`

During local development, it is natural to tweak configurations. Some of these configurations are _meant_ to be shared through git, such as the endpoint for a new integration that may be used during local development. Other configurations are only meant for a specific debug session or a developer's personal preferences, which _should not be shared_ through git, such as lowering the log level below warning.

The configuration in the `appsettings.local.json` file takes precedence over **all** other configurations and is only loaded in the **Development environment**. Additionally, it is ignored by git through the `.gitignore` file.
Local E2E launchers set `RUNNING_E2E_TESTS=true`, which skips `appsettings.local.json` for the runtime projects so E2E runs use the checked-in development configuration instead of developer-specific overrides.
This does not affect the E2E test-project `appsettings.local.json` used for `ExplicitTests`.

If developers need to add configuration that should be shared, they should use `appsettings.Development.json`. If the configuration is not meant to be shared, they can create an `appsettings.local.json` file to override the desired settings.

Here is an example of enabling debug logging only locally:
```json5
// appsettings.local.json
{
    "Serilog": {
        "WriteTo": [
            {
                "Name": "Console",
                "Args": {
                    "outputTemplate": "[{Timestamp:HH:mm:ss.fff} {Level:u3}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}"
                }
            }
        ],
        "MinimumLevel": {
            "Default": "Debug"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Adding `appsettings.local.json` to new projects
Add the following to the `Program.cs` file to load the `appsettings.local.json` file:
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
// or var builder = CoconaApp.CreateBuilder(args);
// or var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);
// or some other builder implementing IHostApplicationBuilder

// Left out for brevity
builder.Configuration
    // Add local configuration as the last configuration source to override other configurations
    //.AddSomeOtherConfiguration()
    .AddLocalConfiguration(builder.Environment);

// Left out for brevity
```
`AddLocalConfiguration` also skips `appsettings.local.json` when `RUNNING_E2E_TESTS=true`.

## Testing

Besides ordinary unit and integration tests, the primary end-to-end tests are the WebAPI and GraphQL C# test projects listed below. K6 tests still exist, but new end-to-end coverage should be added to the C# projects.

- [E2E tests (WebAPI + GraphQL)](docs/E2E-Tests.md)
- [Scripts E2E](scripts/e2e/README.md)
- [K6 testing](tests/k6/README.md)

If you use Rider for local E2E, the repository includes ready-made `.run/` profiles for `WebApi (E2E)`, `GraphQL (E2E)`, `Service (E2E)`, and `E2E (WebAPI/GQL/Service)`.

## Pull requests
For pull requests, the title must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
The title of the PR will be used as the commit message when squashing/merging the pull request, and the body of the PR will be used as the description.

This title will be used to generate the changelog (using [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action))
Using `fix` will add to "Bug Fixes", `feat` will add to "Features", `chore` will add to "Miscellaneous Chores". All the others, `test`, `ci`, `trivial` etc., will be ignored. ([Example release](https://github.com/altinn/dialogporten/releases/tag/v1.12.0))

## Deployment

This repository contains code for both infrastructure and applications. Configurations for infrastructure are located in `.azure/infrastructure`. Application configuration is in `.azure/applications`. 

### Deployment process / GitHub actions

See [docs/CI-CD.md](docs/CI-CD.md)

### Infrastructure

Infrastructure definitions for the project are located in the `.azure/infrastructure` folder. To add new infrastructure components, follow the existing pattern found within this directory. This involves creating new Bicep files or modifying existing ones to define the necessary infrastructure resources.

For example, to add a new storage account, you would:
- Create or update a Bicep file within the `.azure/infrastructure` folder to include the storage account resource definition.
- Ensure that the Bicep file is referenced correctly in `.azure/infrastructure/main.bicep` to be included in the deployment process.

Refer to [docs/Infrastructure.md](docs/Infrastructure.md) for more detailed information.

### Applications

All application Bicep definitions are located in the `.azure/applications` folder. To add a new application, follow the existing pattern found within this directory. This involves creating a new folder for your application under `.azure/applications` and adding the necessary Bicep files (`main.bicep` and environment-specific parameter files, e.g., `test.bicepparam`, `staging.bicepparam`).

For example, to add a new application named `web-api-new`, you would:
- Create a new folder: `.azure/applications/web-api-new`
- Add a `main.bicep` file within this folder to define the application's infrastructure.
- Use the appropriate `Bicep`-modules within this file. There is one for `Container apps` which you most likely would use.
- Add parameter files for each environment (e.g., `test.bicepparam`, `staging.bicepparam`) to specify environment-specific values.

Refer to the existing applications like `web-api-so` and `web-api-eu` as templates.
