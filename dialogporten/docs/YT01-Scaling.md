# YT01 Scaling

The YT01 environment is scaled down outside working hours to save costs. A set of GitHub Actions workflows handle scaling the environment on and off, with support for postponing the scheduled shutdown.

## TL;DR

1. Scale the environment on using the [manual scaling workflow](https://github.com/Altinn/dialogporten/actions/workflows/dispatch-scale-yt01-manual.yml) with `state: on`
2. If you need the environment beyond 18:00 CEST / 17:00 CET, set `postpone_until` to a later time (e.g. `2026-04-10 20:00`)
3. When you're done, scale the environment off using the manual workflow with `state: off` to keep costs low

## Scaling On

Use the **manual workflow** (`dispatch-scale-yt01-manual.yml`) with `state: on`.

Inputs:

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `state` | Yes | — | Set to `on` |
| `deploy` | No | `true` | If a newer release exists, deploy it automatically |
| `postpone_until` | No | — | Datetime to postpone the scheduled shutdown until, in Norwegian time (e.g. `2026-03-01 20:00`). Full ISO 8601 also accepted. |

What happens when scaling on:
1. Workload profile nodes are scaled up
2. PostgreSQL server is started
3. Container app revisions are activated
4. Scheduled container app jobs are resumed
5. Public network access is enabled
6. Availability test (health check) is enabled
7. If `deploy` is true and a newer release exists, the CI/CD workflow is triggered

> **Note:** If a new version is deployed during scale-on, wait for the deployment workflow to finish before running tests against the environment. The deploy runs asynchronously, so the environment may still be starting up with the new version.

## Scaling Off

Use the **manual workflow** (`dispatch-scale-yt01-manual.yml`) with `state: off`.

This always clears any active postpone before shutting down, so a manual scale-off cannot be blocked by a postpone.

## Scheduled Shutdown

The **scheduled workflow** (`dispatch-scale-yt01-scheduled.yml`) runs daily at **16:00 UTC** (17:00 CET / 18:00 CEST).

Before scaling down, it checks for an active postpone. If the postpone timestamp is still in the future, the shutdown is skipped. If the timestamp has passed, the postpone is cleared and shutdown proceeds.

The scheduled workflow cannot be triggered manually. This is by design — manual scale-off should go through the manual workflow to properly clear postpone state.

## Postpone Behavior

Postponing prevents the scheduled shutdown from running until a given time. Key points:

- Set via the `postpone_until` input when scaling on (e.g. if you need the environment to stay up past 18:00 CEST / 17:00 CET)
- **Can be set even when the environment is already running** — it just sets a future timestamp that the scheduled shutdown checks
- The timestamp is stored as a GitHub environment variable (`YT01_DB_SHUTDOWN_POSTPONE_UNTIL`). You can also check the raw value at [Settings > Variables > Actions](https://github.com/Altinn/dialogporten/settings/variables/actions), but this requires elevated permissions (likely admin)
- Every run of both workflows shows the current postpone state on the **Summary tab** — check the latest run of either workflow to see whether a postpone is active
- The scheduled workflow checks this variable each day. If the timestamp is in the future, shutdown is skipped
- The scheduled shutdown only runs once per day (at 16:00 UTC), so a postpone that extends past that time will keep the environment running for an additional 24 hours until the next scheduled run
- Stale (past-dated) postpone values are automatically cleaned up by both the manual and scheduled workflows

### Examples

Keep the environment running until 20:00 tonight:
- Run the manual workflow with `state: on` and `postpone_until: 2026-04-08 20:00`
- Or, if the environment is already running, just run it with `state: on` and the `postpone_until` value — the scale-on is idempotent
- The time is interpreted as Norwegian time (CET/CEST), so no need to think about UTC offsets

Clear an active postpone without scaling off:
- Run the manual workflow with `state: on` and `postpone_until` set to a time in the past (e.g. `2020-01-01 00:00`) — this clears the variable, and the next scheduled shutdown will proceed normally

Immediately shut down regardless of any postpone:
- Run the manual workflow with `state: off` — this clears the postpone first

## Scale-Down Order

The scale-down sequence is ordered so that resources are available when needed:

1. Disable availability test (health check monitoring)
2. **Purge E2E test data** — runs before anything else is disabled, since it needs the API and database
3. Disable public network access
4. Deactivate container app revisions (all apps in parallel)
5. Pause scheduled container app jobs (saves original cron schedules for restore)
6. Scale workload profile nodes to 0
7. Stop PostgreSQL server

This sequence is shared between manual and scheduled scale-off via the reusable workflow `workflow-scale-yt01-down.yml`.

## Workflow Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dispatch-scale-yt01-manual.yml` | Manual scale on/off with optional postpone |
| `dispatch-scale-yt01-scheduled.yml` | Daily scheduled shutdown at 16:00 UTC |
| `workflow-scale-yt01-down.yml` | Reusable scale-down logic (called by both manual and scheduled) |
