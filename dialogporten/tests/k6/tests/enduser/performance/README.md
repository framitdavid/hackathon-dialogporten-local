# Enduser get dialogs

This directory holds a performance test for all GET endpoints for `api/v1/enduser/dialogs`. The tests are implemented in the `enduser-search.js`, `enduserRandomSearch.js`, `enduserSearchBreakpoint.js` and `enduserSearchWithThresholds.js` files. The purpose of these tests is to measure the response time and performance of each endpoint when accessed sequentially for different end users. By running these tests, you can identify any bottlenecks or performance issues in the API. They can be executed from the command line or as part of a GitHub Actions workflow. For more information on how to run the tests and view the results, refer to the sections below.

## Prerequisites
- [K6 prerequisites](../../README.md#Prerequisites)

## Test description
The tests have a list of enduser (ssn), and the following endpoints are visited in
sequence for each enduser:
- api/v1/enduser/dialogs?Party=urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:`<ssn>`&search=`<search string>`
- api/v1/enduser/dialogs/`<dialogId>`
- api/v1/enduser/dialogs/`<dialogId>`/activities
- api/v1/enduser/dialogs/`<dialogId>`/activities/`<activityId>`
- api/v1/enduser/dialogs/`<dialogId>`/seenlog
- api/v1/enduser/dialogs/`<dialogId>`/seenlog/`<seenlogId>`
- api/v1/enduser/dialogs/`<dialogId>`/transmissions
- api/v1/enduser/dialogs/`<dialogId>`/transmissions/`<transmissionId>`
- api/v1/enduser/dialogs/`<dialogId>`/context/labellog

## Test files
All the tests listed below performs the steps listed above: 
| Test | description |
|:----:|:-----------:|
|enduser-search.js| A simple test that performs the listed operation without any variations in search parameters|
|enduserRandomSearch.js|The GET dialogs call uses random list of available url parameters, with some variations in values|
|enduserSearchBreakpoint.js|The purpose of this test is to gradually increase the load until certain thresholds are reached, indicating that the system breakpoint is reached|
|enduserSearchWithThresholds.js|Does the same as `enduser-search.js`, but with threshold-values for response times. Runs in the CI/CD workflow for yt01 |


## Run tests
### From cli
1. Navigate to the following directory:
```shell
cd tests/k6/tests/enduser/performance
```
2. Run the test using the following command. Replace `<test file>`, `<test|staging|yt01>`, `<vus>`, and `<duration>` with the desired values. If the environment variables (-e options) are set beforehand, they can be omitted:
```shell
k6 run <test file> \
-e API_VERSION=v1 \
-e API_ENVIRONMENT=<test|staging|yt01> \
-e TOKEN_GENERATOR_USERNAME=<username> \
-e TOKEN_GENERATOR_PASSWORD=<passwd> \
--vus=<vus> \
--duration=<duration>
```
3. Refer to the k6 documentation for more information on usage.

### From GitHub Actions
To run the performance test using GitHub Actions, follow these steps:
1. Go to the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/altinn/dialogporten/actions/workflows/dispatch-k6-performance.yml) page.
2. Select "Run workflow" and fill in the required parameters.
3. Tag the performance test with a descriptive name. 

To run breakpoint-tests, follow the same flow from [this action](https://github.com/altinn/dialogporten/actions/workflows/dispatch-k6-breakpoint.yml)

### GitHub Action with act
Running with act is primarily used for debugging GitHub workflows locally without committing to the repository.
To run the performance test locally using GitHub Actions and act, perform the following steps:
1. [Install act](https://nektosact.com/installation/).
2. Navigate to the root of the repository.
3. Create a `.secrets` file that matches the GitHub secrets used. Example:
```file
TOKEN_GENERATOR_USERNAME:<username>
TOKEN_GENERATOR_PASSWORD:<passwd>
```
    Replace `<username>` and `<passwd>`, same as for generating tokens above. 
##### IMPORTANT: Ensure this file is added to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information. Never commit actual credentials to version control.
4. Run `act` using the command below. Replace `<path-to-testscript>`, `<vus>` and `<duration>` with the desired values:
```shell
act workflow_dispatch \
-j k6-performance \
-s GITHUB_TOKEN=`gh auth token` \
--container-architecture linux/amd64 \
--artifact-server-path $HOME/.act \ 
--input vus=<vus> \
--input duration=<duration> \ 
--input testSuitePath=<path-to-testscript>
```

## Test Results
The test results from tests run from GitHub Actions can be found in the GitHub Actions run log and [grafana](https://altinn-grafana-test-b2b8dpdkcvfuhfd3.eno.grafana.azure.com/d/eek8vrtzba8e8a/k6-prometheus-dialogporten?orgId=1&refresh=30s&var-DS_PROMETHEUS=k6tests-amw&var-namespace=dialogporten&var-testid=All&var-quantile_stat=p99&from=now-30m&to=now&var-adhoc_filter=url%7C%21~%7Ctesttools).
Otherwise, see the output from your CLI
